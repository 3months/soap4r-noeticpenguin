== soap4r ==

    This is a modified version of the soap4r library for
    the Ruby programming language. The official verion
    can be found at:

    http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r

    This modified version simply allows soap4r to run on
    Ruby 1.9. I have not done any extensive testing, merely
    fixed things that I needed to work. If you find problems,
    please drop me a line and I'll do an update to fix it.

    Thanks!
