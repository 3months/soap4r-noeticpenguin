== soap4r ==

    IMPORTANT NOTE:
        This has been heavily modified and I am still in
        the process of testing it. I have been using the
        wsdlDriver with great success. This version includes
        my original patch, plus many other changes but I
        have not tested the gem this produces yet. That
        should be completed some time tomorrow.

    This is a modified version of the soap4r library for
    the Ruby programming language. The official verion
    can be found at:

    http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r

    This modified version simply allows soap4r to run on
    Ruby 1.9. I have not done any extensive testing, merely
    fixed things that I needed to work. If you find problems,
    please drop me a line and I'll do an update to fix it.

    Thanks!
